# Personalized Recipe Recommendation System

This is a comprehensive **Python-based Machine Learning project** that recommends personalized recipes to users based on their preferences, historical ratings, and nutritional profiles. The system uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, clustering, and visualization.

---

## Features

- **Hybrid Recommendation Engine** combining collaborative and content-based filtering.
- **Search functionality** for recipes using ingredients or keywords.
- **Ingredient substitution system** that respects dietary restrictions.
- **K-Means Clustering** for grouping recipes based on nutritional content.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, RÂ² score for recommendation quality.
- **Visual Analytics** including heatmaps and distribution plots.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Setup

Make sure the following datasets are present inside the `data/` folder:
- `enriched_recipes.csv`
- `synthetic_interactions.csv`
- `test_interactions.csv` (optional for evaluation)

### Step 2: Execute the System

Open and run:

```bash
jupyter notebook recipe-recommendation-system.ipynb
```

This notebook includes:
- System setup
- Model training
- Recommendation generation
- Evaluation and visualizations

### Step 3: Clustering Recipes

Run clustering experiments to explore how recipes are grouped by nutrition:

```bash
jupyter notebook Untitled-1.ipynb
```

---

## Evaluation

- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RÂ² Score

Visual output will be saved under the `results/` folder.
